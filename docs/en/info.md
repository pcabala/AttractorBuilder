This page and the Attractor Builder add-on were created as part of my work
on the visualization and analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems.
The goal of the project is to provide clear tools for performing numerical experiments,
studying trajectories, and creating three-dimensional visualizations of attractors in Blender.
