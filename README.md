# Attractor Builder (Blender 4.5)

Generate and refine strange attractors as curve objects. Works with unsaved files; ships with a default library + custom JSONs.

## Features
- Default & Custom modes (JSON-driven)
- One-click build; post-processing (trim/simplify/smooth)
- Works in unsaved .blend (session customs)

## Install
1. Download the latest zip from **Releases**.
2. Blender → Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install… → pick the zip → Enable.

## Usage
- N-panel → **Attractor**
- Pick a system → **Build Attractor**
- (Optional) Post-processing after build

## Custom Library
Place your `custom_attractors.json` in `AttractorBuilder/Lib/` inside the add-on.

## Known Limitations
- First build seeds params from JSON; re-select to refresh UI if needed.
